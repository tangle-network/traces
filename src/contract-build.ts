/**
 * WHICH BUILD of `@tangle-network/agent-trace-contract` is installed here.
 *
 * The version string cannot answer that question. Two builds of this package
 * both declare `1.0.2` — one bounds how many entries `validateTraceSpans` reads
 * and reports the clipping as `truncated-input`, the other reads whatever the
 * input's `length` claims — so a version comparison passes on both and tells a
 * reader nothing about the code that produced a span.
 *
 * Identity therefore comes from the bytes, twice over:
 *
 * - `traceContractBuildId` hashes the installed `dist/` tree, so two different
 *   builds get two different ids however they version themselves. That id is
 *   what `writeOtlpFile` stamps on every artifact this package exports.
 * - `verifyInstalledTraceContract` checks the installed tree against the ONE
 *   build the repo's own pnpm-lock.yaml pins. This is an allowlist derived
 *   from the lockfile, not a digest pinned in source and not a denylist of a
 *   known-bad tree: the lockfile names the locked build by the sha512 of its
 *   published tarball, and the per-file expectation is re-derived from tarball
 *   bytes that must re-hash to that sha512 before they are believed. Any
 *   installed tree that is not byte-identical to the locked build fails —
 *   stale, future-corrupt, or decorated — and a legitimate upgrade moves the
 *   lockfile entry, so the expectation follows it with no digest to update by
 *   hand.
 *
 * Resolution goes through Node's own resolver rather than a guessed path, so
 * both describe the build this process would actually import — including when
 * that build is reached through a symlinked virtual store belonging to a
 * different checkout.
